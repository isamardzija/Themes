# Quae Website Theme
Quae *(search for, seek, strive for)* is a light-weight, fully responsive website made in CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Quae shows off what can be achieved with just a speck of CSS and JavaScript. It responds to your device size, and adjusts the sidebar toggling accordingly. If you are viewing it on a big screen (laptop, PC...) the sidebar has enough space to co-exist next to the content itself. However, if you are on a phone or a tablet, where screen estate is previous, the sidebar will move away so that the content can be displayed. If you need it, you can of course toggle it in both instances.

## Lessons Learned:

Figured out a neat trick on how Javascript and CSS interact with eachother. I used custom pseudo classes and then accessed them using JavaScript in order to determine how the sidebar should behave.
